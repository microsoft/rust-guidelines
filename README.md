A collection of pragmatic design guidelines helping developers to produce idiomatic Rust that scales.

👉 [**Pragmatic Rust Guidelines**](https://microsoft.github.io/rust-guidelines)

## Development

The guidelines use [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook). Once installed you can view them locally via

```bash
mdbook serve --open
```

To submit new guidelines, file a PR. They should be

- beneficial for { safety, efficiency, maintenance },
- agreeable to a majority of experienced (3+ years) Rust developers,
- comprehensible to Rust novices (4+ weeks),
- practically applicable in real world scenarios.
