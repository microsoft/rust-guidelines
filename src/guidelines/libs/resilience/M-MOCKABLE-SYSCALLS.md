## I/O and System Calls Are Mockable (M-MOCKABLE-SYSCALLS) { #M-MOCKABLE-SYSCALLS }

<why>To make otherwise hard-to-evoke edge cases testable.</why>
<version>0.2</version>

Any user-facing type doing I/O, or sys calls with side effects, should be mockable to these effects. This includes file and
network access, clocks, entropy sources and seeds, and similar. More generally, any operation that is

- non-deterministic,
- reliant on external state,
- depending on the hardware or the environment,
- is otherwise fragile or not universally reproducible

should be mockable.

This guideline has several implications for libraries, they

- should not perform ad-hoc I/O, i.e., call `read("foo.txt")`
- should not rely on non-mockable I/O and sys calls
- should not create their own I/O or sys call _core_ themselves
- should not offer `MyIoLibrary::default()` constructors

Instead, libraries performing I/O and sys calls should either accept some I/O _core_ that is mockable already, or provide mocking functionality themselves:

```rust, ignore
let lib = Library::new_runtime(runtime_io); // mockable I/O functionality passed in
let (lib, mock) = Library::new_mocked(); // supports inherent mocking
```

Libraries supporting inherent mocking should implement it as follows:

```rust, ignore
pub struct Library {
    some_core: LibraryCore // Encapsulates syscalls, I/O, ... compare below.
}

impl Library {
    pub fn new() -> Self { ... }
    pub fn new_mocked() -> (Self, MockCtrl) { ... }
}
```

Behind the scenes, `LibraryCore` is a non-public enum, similar to [M-RUNTIME-ABSTRACTED], that either dispatches
calls to the respective sys call, or to an mocking controller.

```rust, ignore
// Dispatches calls either to the operating system, or to a
// mocking controller.
enum LibraryCore {
    Native,

    #[cfg(feature = "test-util")]
    Mocked(mock::MockCtrl)
}

impl LibraryCore {
    // Some function you'd forward to the operating system.
    fn random_u32(&self) {
        match self {
            Self::Native => unsafe { os_random_u32() }
            Self::Mocked(m) => m.random_u32()
        }
    }
}


#[cfg(feature = "test-util")]
mod mock {
    // This follows the M-SERVICES-CLONE pattern, so both `LibraryCore` and
    // the user can hold on to the same `MockCtrl` instance.
    pub struct MockCtrl {
        inner: Arc<MockCtrlInner>
    }

    // Implement required logic accordingly, usually forwarding to
    // `MockCtrlInner` below.
    impl MockCtrl {
        pub fn set_next_u32(&self, x: u32) { ... }
        pub fn random_u32(&self) { ... }
    }

    // Contains actual logic, e.g., the next random number we should return.
    struct MockCtrlInner {
        next_call: u32
    }
}
```

Runtime-aware libraries already build on top of the [M-RUNTIME-ABSTRACTED] pattern should extend their runtime enum instead:

```rust, ignore
enum Runtime {
    #[cfg(feature="tokio")]
    Tokio(tokio::Tokio),

    #[cfg(feature="smol")]
    Smol(smol::Smol)

    #[cfg(feature="test-util")]
    Mock(mock::MockCtrl)
}
```

As indicated above, most libraries supporting mocking should not accept mock controllers, but return them via parameter tuples,
with the first parameter being the library instance, the second the mock controller. This is to prevent state ambiguity if multiple
instances shared a single controller:

```rust, ignore
impl Library {
    pub fn new_mocked() -> (Self, MockCtrl) { ... } // good
    pub fn new_mocked_bad(&mut MockCtrl) -> Self { ... } // prone to misuse
}
```
