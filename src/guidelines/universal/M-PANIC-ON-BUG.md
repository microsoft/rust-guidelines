## Detected Programming Bugs are Panics, Not Errors (M-PANIC-ON-BUG) { #M-PANIC-ON-BUG }

<why>To avoid impossible error handling code and ensure runtime consistency.</why>
<version>1.0</version>

As an extension of [M-PANIC-IS-STOP](M-PANIC-IS-STOP) above, when an unrecoverable programming error has been
detected, libraries and applications must panic, i.e., request program termination.

In these cases, no `Error` type should be introduced or returned, as any such error could not be acted upon at runtime.

Contract violations, i.e., the breaking of invariants either within a library or by a caller, are programming errors and must therefore panic.

However, what constitutes a violation is situational. APIs are not expected to go out of their way to detect them, as such
checks can be impossible or expensive. Encountering `must_be_even == 3` during an already existing check clearly warrants
a panic, while a function `parse(&str)` clearly must return a `Result`. If in doubt, we recommend you take inspiration from the standard library.

```rust, ignore
// Generally, a function with bad parameters must either
// - Ignore a parameter and/or return the wrong result
// - Signal an issue via Result or similar
// - Panic
// If in this `divide_by` we see that y == 0, panicking is
// the correct approach.
fn divide_by(x: u32, y: u32) -> u32 { ... }

// However, it can also be permissible to omit such checks
// and return an unspecified (but not an undefined) result.
fn divide_by_fast(x: u32, y: u32) -> u32 { ... }

// Here, passing an invalid URI is not a contract violation.
// Since parsing is inherently fallible, a Result must be returned.
fn parse_uri(s: &str) -> Result<Uri, ParseError> { };

```
