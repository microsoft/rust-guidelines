## I disagree with a guideline ...

If you find a mistake or issue, [let us know](https://github.com/microsoft/rust-guidelines). Also let us know if a _must_ guideline interferes with
a valid use case. If you disagree with a _should_ guideline, there are usually valid exceptions we haven't documented. If you think a _should_ guideline
generally leads to worse outcomes, let us know.
